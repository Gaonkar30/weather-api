# Weather API with Redis Caching

This project is a simple weather API that fetches weather data using the Visual Crossing API and caches the results using Redis. The API returns weather information for a given city, with caching to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Redis server
- Visual Crossing API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-api.git
   cd weather-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Redis:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install redis-server
   ```

4. Start the Redis server:
   ```sh
   sudo service redis-server start
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:
   ```sh
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add your Visual Crossing API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   VISUAL_CROSSING_API_KEY=your_visual_crossing_api_key
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```

2. Make a request to the API:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/weather?city=London
   ```

## Code Explanation

### `server.js`

- **Dependencies**: The project uses `express` for the server, `axios` for making HTTP requests to the Visual Crossing API, `redis` for caching, and `dotenv` for managing environment variables.

- **Redis Client**: A Redis client is created to interact with the Redis server. It handles connections and executes Redis commands.

- **Weather Endpoint**: The `/weather` endpoint accepts a city as a query parameter, checks the Redis cache for data, fetches data from the Visual Crossing API if not cached, and stores the fetched data in Redis with a 12-hour expiration.

### Redis Caching

- **Check Cache**: Before making an API call, the server checks if the weather data for the requested city is already cached in Redis.

- **Cache Data**: If the data is not in the cache, the server fetches it from the Visual Crossing API and stores it in Redis with an expiration time of 12 hours.

- **Return Data**: The API returns the cached data if available, or the freshly fetched data if not cached.

## Error Handling

- **Redis Errors**: Errors related to Redis operations are logged, and a 500 status code is returned.
- **API Errors**: Errors from the Visual Crossing API are logged, and a 500 status code is returned.
